1) Build an algorithm in algorithm.codingdojo.com that would print all the numbers between 1 to 255

set x to be 0
if x is less than 256,
do {
	print x
	set x to be x + 1
	go to line 2
}

2) Build an algorithm that would print all the odd numbers between 1 to 255.

set x to be 0
if x is less than 256,
do{
	print x
	set x to be x + 2
	go to line 2
}


3) (Challenge) See if you can build an algorithm that would print the SUM of all numbers between 3 and 7. (SUM means that we add all the numbers from 3-7; we add 3+4+5+6+7)

Set x to be 3
set b to be 3
if x is less than 7
do{
	print x+", "+b
	set x to be x + 1
	set b to be b + x
	go to line 3
}


4) (Challenge) See if you can build an algorithm that would print the SUM of all numbers between 1 and 255. (Add all the numbers from 1 to 255, and PRINT the SUM).

set a to be 1
set d to be 1
if a is less than 255
do{
	print a+", "+d
	set a to be a + 1
	set b to be b + a
	go to line 3
}
