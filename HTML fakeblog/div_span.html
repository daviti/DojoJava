		<h1>Dognate</h1>
		<p> Dognate’s vision is to ensure every dog in America (and eventually the world) has a warm bed, food and toys to live a happy life, at home or in a shelter. They are our best friends that love us unconditionally. The only and best thing we can do for them is to give them a good life. </p>
		<p> Dognate’s mission is to connect dog owners and organizations that are in need of supplies. Dognate helps organizations and dog owners exchange, donate or volunteer where help is most needed. </p>

		<h2>How Dognate works</h2>
		<p>•Some dog rescue organizations lack time or resources to obtain needed supplies. Generous pet owners can help by picking up and dropping off supplies. 
		•Low-income families that are responsible dog owners might not have the proper supplies for their dogs, or are in need of some. Dognate connects people with supplies to people that need them.
		•Some dog organizations are in need of bedding, blankets etc, since their services are done outdoors.
		•Pet stores that have extra supplies assist our mission to make sure every dog has what they need for a happy life. 
		•Donations to any dog oriented nonprofit via Network for Good.
		•FUTURE: crowd funding donations of money where needed. </p>
